    "time more accurately will not only improve the user experience but also help optimise routing and courier management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the total delivery time (in minutes) for a food order, based on\n",

    "Time_of_Day: The time of day when the delivery took place.\n",

    "Delivery time is a continuous target and often roughly related to linear combinations of features (distance, prep time, traffic), so linear regression with an MSE loss is a natural, interpretable baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE objective is convex and differentiable, so gradient descent reliably finds the global minimum and scales to larger datasets or many features where the normal equation is expensive or unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent easily integrates feature standardisation and regularisation (L2/L1), improving convergence and preventing overfitting while keeping model coefficients interpretable."
